## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue with config of the exporter simple open an issue with the label `security` and I will be in contact with you shortly.

Be aware that I am not responsible for the actual binary running the exporter since it is provided by the prometheus community. For more information check [here](https://github.com/prometheus/graphite_exporter/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
